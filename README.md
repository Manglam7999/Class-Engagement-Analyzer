# Class-Engagement-Analyzer
Developed a system that evaluates the quality of class by sensing the emotions of students. It is based on the sequential model of neural networks involved in deep learning. It captures the image of the user, crops the unwanted part to capture the face using haar cascade, and decides the involvement using emotion depicted.
